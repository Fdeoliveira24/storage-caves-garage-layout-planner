You broke my mobile interface and I want to completely rebuild it in a clean, professional way. You mock up looks terrible also. 

Context:
- This is an enterprise-grade garage/storage layout planner, not a toy app.
- The current mobile UI you generated looks clunky and childish.
- I need a modern, minimalist intuitive, high-quality interface that matches the Storage Caves brand and does NOT introduce regressions. Use mobile interface like Notion, Canva, and GitHub as inspiration. Use proper icon library. 

Hard requirements:

1. NO REGRESSIONS
- Do NOT change or remove any core business logic, data models, item definitions, or canvas behavior.
- Do NOT rename or remove existing public methods used by other modules (App, Items, FloorPlans, Canvas, etc.).
- Keep all existing event wiring intact: same IDs, class hooks, and function signatures unless you also safely update every call site.
- Before making changes, scan MobileUIManager.js, App.js, and related files to understand the current flow, then keep that behavior working.

2. IMAGE PATHS MUST STAY
For items, keep these image paths exactly as they are and make sure the UI still uses them correctly:
- paletteImage: 'assets/images/items/palette/van-side.png'
- canvasImage:  'assets/images/items/canvas/van-top.png'

3. BRANDING / COLORS
- Detect and reuse the existing Storage Caves brand colors already present in the project (primary purple, dark backgrounds, etc.).
- Do not swap to a random new color scheme.
- Keep contrast strong and text easy to read on mobile.

4. MOBILE UI REDESIGN GOALS
Redesign ONLY the mobile interface layer (layout, components, styling) to be:
- clean and professional
- easy to scan on a small screen
- consistent with the desktop design system
- touch-friendly with proper spacing and tap targets

Focus screens:
- Floor Plans list
- Items palette
- Canvas tools / actions
- “More” / settings or overflow area

General layout guidelines:
- Keep a bottom tab bar, but make icons and labels clean and aligned.
- Use clear section headers (e.g., “Floor Plans”, “Items”, “Canvas”) with good spacing.
- For cards (floor plans and items), use consistent border radius, padding, and typography.
- Use a single unified card style for lists instead of multiple mixed styles.
- Keep important actions (like “Select”, “Add”, “Undo/Redo duplicate, Delete”) clearly visible and easy to press with a thumb.
- Avoid unnecessary gradients, drop shadows, and clutter.
5. IMPLEMENTATION RULES
- Work mainly in the mobile UI manager and style files. Do not restructure the whole project.
- Keep selectors stable where possible. If you introduce new classes/IDs, explain why and where they are used.
- Make sure the new layout is responsive to typical phone widths (e.g., 768–320 px).
- Ensure scroll behavior works smoothly for long lists (floor plans, items).
- Respect safe areas (no UI cut off by notches or system bars where possible).

7. TESTING CHECKLIST (YOU MUST RUN THROUGH THIS)
After your changes, confirm and explain in detail:
- Floor plans list renders correctly and is scrollable.
- Items list renders correctly, uses the correct paletteImage path, and tapping items still adds them to the canvas using the same logic as before.
- double check Canvas screen still works (pan, zoom, pinch select items, etc. as it did before).
- No console errors (for example, Items.getAllItems is still a valid function or equivalent behavior is preserved).
- All existing main buttons and flows still work exactly as before.

8. OUTPUT
At the end:
- List each file you changed.
- Show the final code for the modified sections (not just diffs).
- Explain, in plain language, how the new UI layout works and why it is more professional and easier to use on mobile while keeping all previous functionality.

Now, start by analyzing the current mobile UI, propose the redesign plan, then implement it carefully following all the rules above.

Call the architect as many times as necessary. Focus on the UI
