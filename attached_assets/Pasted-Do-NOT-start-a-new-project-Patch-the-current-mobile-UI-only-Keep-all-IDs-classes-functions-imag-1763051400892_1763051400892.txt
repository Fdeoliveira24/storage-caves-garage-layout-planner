Do NOT start a new project. Patch the current mobile UI only.
Keep all IDs, classes, functions, image paths, and data the same.

Fixes (mobile)
	1.	Top tabs (one place)

	•	Put Floor Plans, Items, and Saved in the same tab strip at the top.
	•	When a user picks a plan or item (or taps a saved layout), close the tab sheet with a left slide.
	•	Remember the last-opened tab.

	2.	Floor Plans tab

	•	Remove the icon from each card.
	•	Keep text only: title, size (W × L), Door: WxH, and sq ft.
	•	Simple, minimal style. Selected state stays.

	3.	Items tab

	•	Keep the grid and images.
	•	Use one background color inside the card (either all white or all gray). No mix.

	4.	Saved layouts

	•	Move Saved into the same top tab strip (with Floor Plans and Items).
	•	Show the same list and actions (load/overwrite/delete).
	•	Remove the Saved tab from the bottom bar.

	5.	Canvas screen

	•	Put the Canvas icon in the center of the bottom bar.
	•	Replace the always-on action bar with a small action button that opens a compact panel, or a draggable vertical panel on the left.
	•	Actions in that panel: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Center, Rotate, Duplicate, Delete, Bring to Front, Send to Back.
	•	Fix zoom + center logic:
	•	Center should fit the current floor plan group to view, then pan to the middle.
	•	Use zoomToPoint({x: canvas.width/2, y: canvas.height/2}, newZoom) and clamp min/max.
	•	After zoom, call requestRenderAll() and keep the floor plan centered (no random jumps).
	•	New item placement bug: when adding an item, place it at the canvas center (same as desktop): get canvas.getCenter() and set the object with originX:'center', originY:'center'.

	6.	More → View Options (auto-close)
Add a section with these options. When the user picks one, close the menu and apply immediately:

	•	Hide Grid (toggle)
	•	Hide Entry Label (toggle)
	•	Hide Entry Border (toggle)
	•	Entry Zone (radio): Bottom ✓ / Left / Right / Top

	7.	Project name

	•	Add editable project name at the top (same as desktop).
	•	Tapping the name opens rename; store it in the same state and use it for exports.

	8.	New Layout

	•	Move + New Layout to the bottom bar as the first icon (far left).
	•	Same behavior as before (confirm if needed), then reset cleanly.

Keep
	•	Image paths must not change (e.g.,
paletteImage: 'assets/images/items/palette/van-side.png'
canvasImage:  'assets/images/items/canvas/van-top.png').
	•	JSON export stays hidden if it was hidden by CSS.

Confirm in your reply
	•	One top tab strip with Floor Plans / Items / Saved; sheet closes with left slide on selection.
	•	Plan cards: no icon; door size shown.
	•	Items: single background color inside cards.
	•	Saved works inside the tab strip.
	•	Canvas: centered bottom icon; action panel works; zoom/center fixed; new items spawn in the middle.
	•	View Options added and auto-close on pick.
	•	Project name editable at top.
	•	+ New Layout moved to the bottom bar (far left).
	•	No console errors. List files changed and paste the final code for the changed parts only.
