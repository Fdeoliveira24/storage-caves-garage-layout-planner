Do NOT start over. Keep the current project and only patch the mobile UI.
	•	No new files unless required.
	•	Do not change IDs, classes, public functions, or data.
	•	Keep image paths as they are.

Fix list (mobile)
	1.	Tabs together

	•	Put Floor Plans and Items in the same top tab strip so users can switch between them in one place. Default to Floor Plans.

	2.	Floor Plan cards

	•	Remove the plan icon from each card.
	•	Keep: title, size (W × L), Door: WxH, and sq ft.
	•	Clean, minimal style. Selected state stays.

	3.	Items cards

	•	Keep the thumbnails and layout.
	•	Use one background color inside the card (pick a neutral gray or the current gray). No mixed white/gray.

	4.	Saved tab

	•	Remove the Saved tab from the bottom bar.
	•	Add “Saved Layouts” as a row under the More screen that opens the same list.

	5.	Canvas screen (broken)

	•	In the bottom bar, make the Canvas icon centered.
	•	Replace the always-visible action bar with a toggle:
	•	Add a small action button (or icon) near the Canvas tab that opens a compact action sheet.
	•	Actions in the sheet: Undo, Redo, Duplicate, Delete, Rotate, Bring to Front, Send to Back.
	•	The sheet must not cover the canvas when closed. If you keep it floating, make it draggable.
	•	Zoom / Center: Fix the buttons so they zoom in/out smoothly and center the current floor plan. The “center” button should fit the floor plan to view and center it (do not jump to random spots).
	•	New item placement bug: When an item is added, place it at the canvas center (same as desktop), not at the top edge.

	6.	More → View Options
Add this section and wire to the existing logic:

	•	Hide Grid (toggle)
	•	Hide Entry Label (toggle)
	•	Hide Entry Border (toggle)
	•	Entry Zone (radio): Bottom ✓ / Left / Right / Top

	7.	Project name

	•	Add “Rename Layout” to the More screen (same behavior as desktop). The new name should show in the header and be used by Export.

Brand and spacing
	•	Use Storage Caves colors: red, dark gray, light gray, white.
	•	Keep tap targets ≥ 44px. Respect safe areas. No overlap with the canvas.
